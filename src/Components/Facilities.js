            <p>
              To ensure everyone’s safety, all Campers entering either facility
              must participate in an active pre-screening and campers are
              required to have their temperature checked by an on-site Camp
              Shine staff member EVERY DAY. Our questions are relating to having
              symptoms, previous contact with others who may have COVID-19 or
              have travelled outside of Canada. If any of the questions are
              answered yes, the staff will request that you consider visiting
              your health care provider and to stay at home. All completed
              questionnaires are kept for our records for contact tracing
              purposes for the Middlesex-London Health Unit, if individuals need
              to be contacted due to outbreak.
            </p>
            <p>
              The daily online COVID-19 questionnaire will be sent to parents
              everyday.
